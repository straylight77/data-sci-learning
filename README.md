# Certificate in Data Science (McMaster University)

[Program Overview](https://continuing.mcmaster.ca/programs/tech-data/data-science/)

### DAT 201 - Data Analytics & Modelling

This course offers an introduction to data science and machine learning paving the way for students to learn data analytics principles. In particular, this course begins with a brief history of data analytics and data science, followed by regression analysis, regression and classification trees, and ends with introductions to K-means clustering, principal component analysis (PCA). Each lecture has associated with it a practical lab session which students will put theory into practice offering students a hands-on approach to learning the material.

_Final Project:_ [Linear Regression of Life Expectancy and Term Life Insurance

### DAT 202 - Data Management

Data analytics problems require new tools/technologies to store and manage the data to realize the business benefit. This course explores the importance of managing data as an enterprise asset and the data management components required in term of the acquisition, storage, sharing, validation and accessibility of data for addressing business problems. An examination of Database Management Systems, database architectures, the differences between OLTP (Online transaction processing) OLAP (online analytical processing) and the administrative processes that guide the data lifecycle will be a focus of the course.

_Research Paper:_ [Modernising Data Science Project Management](https://github.com/straylight77/data-sci-learning/blob/master/dat202/paper/Modernising%20Data%20Science%20Project%20Management%20(Colin%20Bowers).pdf)

### DAT 203 - Predictive Modelling and Data Mining

The course will introduce predictive modelling techniques as well as related statistical and visualization tools for data mining. The course will cover common machine learning techniques that are focused on predictive outcomes. Students will learn how to evaluate the performance of the prediction models and how to improve them through time.

_Final Project:_ [Predicting Customer Churn For E-Commerce](https://github.com/straylight77/data-sci-learning/blob/master/dat203/Predicting%20Customer%20Churn%20For%20E-Commerce%20-%20Colin%20Bowers%20(DAT%20203).pdf)

### DAT 301 - Machine Learning for Big Data Analytics

Building on the fundamental principles of data analytics, this course advances to modern machine learning techniques such as neural network, deep learning, and reinforcement learning as well as NLP and text analysis. Application activities will be structured to provide an introductory level of how machine learning techniques are applied to big data analytics.

### DAT 205 - Data Science Capstone Project 

The course provides students with a real-world business problem/project in order to apply analytics models, methodologies and tools learned in the program. Faculty mentors will work with students to ensure the capstone project reflects, and encompasses, best practices for project management, data analytics and data science.

# Question # 1
#
# Generate 10000 sample from Zero Inflated Negative binomial distribution. 
#   (https://rdrr.io/rforge/countreg/man/zinbinom.html). 
#   Each sample should have 30 observations in it.
# Organize the data into a matrix.
# Create the sampling distribution of sample mean.
# Provide necessary figures and comments

# Required package for the rzinbinom() function 
# install.packages("countreg", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")
library(countreg)

set.seed(123456)

n = 30      # no. of observations per sample
t = 10      # no. of trials within each observation
p = 0.5     # probability of success for each trial
N = 100000  # no. of samples

# mu: the theoretical mean of the population
mu = t * p

# sigma: the theoretical std dev of the population 
sigma = sqrt(p*(1-p))

# S: the sample data.  Placed into a matrix shaped N rows x n cols.
S = matrix(rzinbinom(n*N, mu, t, pi=0), nrow=N)

# S.means: a vector containing the mean of each row of S
S.means = rowMeans(S)
hist(S.means, prob=TRUE, xlab="Sample Mean")

# xbar: mean of the sample means
xbar = mean(S.means)
abline(v=xbar, col="red")

# plot the theoretical normal distribution
xx = seq(min(S.means), max(S.means), by=0.01)
lines(xx, dnorm(xx, mu, sigma), col="blue") 

results = c(
  "mu" = mu,
  "xbar" = xbar,
  "sigma" = sigma,
  "s" = sd(S.means)
)
results

#   5.0000000 5.0023307 0.5000000 0.5003995 
#
# The theoretical normal distribution follows the distribution of sample means 
# quite closely. This implies the mean and std dev between both distributions 
# should also be very close which is what our results show.  Since our sample 
# size of 100,000 is large, this is in agreement with the Central Limit Theorem.
